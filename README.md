# Guidance-robot

This is a project for turtlebot based on [ROS](https://www.ros.org/).

It is hard for me to find the office location when I come into the CSE building of UCSD. I think it should be the same for every people when they come to a new environment. People may feel distressed and unhappy when they wandering off and cannot find the exact location of their destination. They are about to be late for their meetings!

We develop a Guidance robot to help this issue.
